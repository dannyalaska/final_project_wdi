# Final Project Proposal


I am going to use phaser to create a penguin launching game. 

The game starts with a penguin ready to get launched, with each launch you're going to be able to pilot the flying penguin as it soars through the air to collect fish. Each fish gets you more points. 

The turn ends when the penguin either collides with a platform from the bottom and dies or lands on a platform and gets the value of points for that platform.
