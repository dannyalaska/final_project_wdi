#### Roughly 80% of people that go to the gym regularly do some sort of cardio during their time there. (That is a made up statistic).  Most, if not all, of these people are doing their cardio blindly hoping to get results; weight loss, endurance, cardiovascular strength, etc.
#### My app is designed to use metabolic calculations to determine the proper amount of time during each of the 3 major types of cardio workouts.
+ The workout times are specific, the intervals are randomized, allowing users to pick out intervals that suit their desired effort levels or abilities.
+ An article has been provided to help users understand the ideology behind the cardio plan.
